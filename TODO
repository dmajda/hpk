These are the areas I intend to work on in the HTML Presentation Toolkit.

Version 1.0
-----------
* Basic OSF template
* Presentation/normal CSS
* Skinnability
  * ability to choose skin
  * default skin
  * maybe more skins
* Localization
  * cs-CZ
  * en-US
  * automatic detection (probably based on lang/xml:lang attribute on <html>
    element), but overridable
* Presentation/normal mode working in Opera and Firefox
* Keyboard navigation
* Display slide number
* "Goto" input box
* Browser support
  * Opera 9.5+
  * Safari (some recent version)
  * IE 6/7+
  * Forefox 3+
* Sophisticated intro/example presentation
* Project website

Later versions
--------------
* Sophisticated incremental display of slides (maybe)
