These are the areas I intend to work on in the HTML Presentation Toolkit.

Version 1.0
-----------
* Better UI experience (suggested by Met)
  * Look at Google Docs
  * Maybe show some semi-transparent layer with arrows (just Unicode characters?)
  * Maybe some navigation controls
  * Automatically run presentation when the browser is switched to full-screen?
    (suggested by Marci)
* Font sizes
  * Allow explicit resizing using browser features or custom controls (suggested
    by Met)
  * Maybe use Opera's solution based on media queries and emulate them in
    unsupported browsers?
    (http://www.opera.com/browser/tutorials/operashow/documentation/doc_stylesheets.dml)
* Improve default skin
* Finish better browser support
  * Safari 3.2+ (missing: keyboard navigation)
  * IE 6/7+ (missing: keyboard navigation, small bullets in presentation)
* Sophisticated intro/example presentation
* Project website

Later versions
--------------
* Sophisticated incremental display of slides (maybe)
  * Display handouts from incrementally displayed slides in normal/print mode,
    even when those slides are not visible themselves (suggested by Met)
