These are the areas I intend to work on in the HTML Presentation Kit.

Version 1.0
-----------
* Finish better browser support
  * Safari 3.2+ (missing: keyboard navigation)
  * IE 6/7+ (missing: keyboard navigation, small bullets in presentation)
* Font sizes
  * Allow explicit resizing using browser features or custom controls (suggested
    by Met)
  * Maybe use Opera's solution based on media queries and emulate them in
    unsupported browsers?
    (http://www.opera.com/browser/tutorials/operashow/documentation/doc_stylesheets.dml)
* Improve default skin
* Sophisticated intro/example presentation
* Project website

Later versions
--------------
Following points are only ideas. I am not sure I will implement any of them.

* Sophisticated incremental display of slides
  * Display handouts from incrementally displayed slides in normal/print mode,
    even when those slides are not visible themselves (suggested by Met)
* Stuff from http://vsemiosmi.blogspot.com/2008/12/publikovani-prezentaci-slideshare.html
  * Automatic slideshow
  * Jump to beginning/end
