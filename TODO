These are the areas I intend to work on in the HTML Presentation Kit.

Version 1.0
-----------
* Font sizes
  * Allow explicit resizing using browser features or custom controls (suggested
    by Met)
* Intro/example presentation
* Project website
* README

* Release criteria:
  * At least one real presentation done with HPK
  * At least three themes (to make sure that the theming support is sufficient)

Later versions
--------------
Following points are only ideas. I am not sure I will implement any of them.

* Sophisticated incremental display of slides
  * Display handouts from incrementally displayed slides in normal/print mode,
    even when those slides are not visible themselves (suggested by Met)
* Stuff from http://vsemiosmi.blogspot.com/2008/12/publikovani-prezentaci-slideshare.html
  * Automatic slideshow
  * Jump to beginning/end
* Opera behavior - should we rely on the OSF only or add JS behavior?
* CSS transitions
  * http://ajaxian.com/archives/s5-presentations-with-css-transitions
* Look at S5 and maybe "steal" some ideas
* CSS class for big vertically-centered captions (suggested by Met)
  * Like in http://www.aiga.org/resources/content/5/3/2/4/documents/AIGA_Gain_JeffreyZeldman.pdf
  * Center using JavaScript if necessary
