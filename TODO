These are the areas I intend to work on in the HTML Presentation Toolkit.

Version 1.0
-----------
* "Goto" input box
* Browser support
  * Safari (some recent version)
  * IE 6/7+
* Font sizes
  * Allow explicit resizing using browser features or custom controls (suggested
    by Met)
  * Maybe use Opera's solution based on media queries and emulate them in
    unsupported browsers?
    (http://www.opera.com/browser/tutorials/operashow/documentation/doc_stylesheets.dml)
* Linkable slides (suggested by Met)
  * URL like "presentation.html#slide15" should switch to presentation mode and
    go to slide 15
* Better UI experience (suggested by Met)
  * Look at Google Docs
  * Maybe show some semi-transparent layer with arrows (just Unicode characters?)
  * Maybe some navigation controls
* Improve default skin
* Localization
  * Automatic detection? Probably based on lang/xml:lang attribute on <html>
    elemen, should be overridable
* Sophisticated intro/example presentation
* Project website

Later versions
--------------
* Sophisticated incremental display of slides (maybe)
  * Display handouts from incrementally displayed slides in normal/print mode,
    even when those slides are not visible themselves (suggested by Met)
